## Final Phase_1 Project.

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation incident data based on the AviationData.csv dataset from Kaggle and tries to identify the manufacturer with the lowest-risk aircraft, the engines with the lowest risk, the damage severity, and the fatalities involved.

The dataset contains: The aircraft make, model, damage, fatalities, and engine type

## Key Findings
Some manufacturers example Piper have some of the lowest-risk aircraft in comparison to other manufacturers such as Boeing.
Engine types also play a role in flight safety. Reciprocating engines are involved in incidents in comparison to turbo jet engines.

## Analysis Process
First was the installation of the required dependencies: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
After loading the data we cleaned it to remove missing data. Followed by risk evaluation to figure out the lowest-risk aircraft.
Created different visualizations to clearly show the incidents.
